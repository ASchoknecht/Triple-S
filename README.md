# Triple-S
Repository for the Triple-S techniques for Process Model Matching

### Description
The Triple-S Java API can be used for Process Model Matching. It is developed as part of my doctoral thesis at the [Institute AIFB](http://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/Hauptseite/en) of the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) (KIT).

### Code and Used Libraries
An example on how to use the LS3 library can be found in the ExammpleUsage.java class.

The code is stored as a maven project with pom.xml included for the external library dependencies. Yet, the following external library and files have to be included manually:

* [Semilar API](http://deeptutor2.memphis.edu/Semilar-Web/): The Semilar API is used to calculate the semantic similarity of words using the implementation of Wu & Palmer'S approach.
